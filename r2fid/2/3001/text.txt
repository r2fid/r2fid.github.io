Mary is Event Director for ReedPOP, focusing on the international Comic Con portfolio, as well as Star Wars Celebration, UFC Fan Expo, and TwitchCon. She moved back to winter after 14 years at Lucasfilm in San Francisco, where she developed and produced Star Wars Celebrations and headed up Fan Relations.

She cares passionately for fans and wants their show experiences to be both memorable and unmatchable.

Mary can also tell you how to correctly put a radio on an Adelie penguin. If you have a cow that's having a breech birth, she can deliver the calf safely for you. Her background includes commercial fishing in Alaska, weight training instruction, cattle ranching in Montana, and a stint on an Antarctic research base. Somehow this all adds up to a perfect fit for a pop culture show team.
