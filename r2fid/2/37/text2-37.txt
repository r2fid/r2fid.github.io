Member of the R2 Builder's Club since
2012. My droid is mostly scratch built
with styrene and was "completed" after
a year and half. There are always more 
things to do! I've taken my droid to
many educational outreach events and
comic conventions. I've taught elect-
ronics and droid building to kids at
the Saint Louis Science Center summer
camp program and was invited to
several other themed science nights
hosted by the Science Center. R2 has
also been to art and science fairs for
Kindergarten-12th  grade. I've spoken
on a droid building panel at the Wizard
World comic convention.

When not droid building, I'm a web app-
lication developer, watching hockey,
movies, playing video games, or simply
enjoying the company of my 
very-soon-to-be wife.
