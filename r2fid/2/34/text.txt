As a young boy I was mesmerized when the ESB movie came out on cinema. Not only was it filmed in the beautiful vicinity of Finse, Norway (Hoth). It took the story to a new level. It also formed my life and made me chose an occupation in the theatre and film industry with lightings and effects.

I joined the R2 builders in 2009 and 501st Legion in 2014. The community of R2 builders has been an inspiration. Building R2 is giving me a lot of challenges and fun. And is a still ongoing project. My R2-D2 is an ESB version since that is my favorite SW movie.
