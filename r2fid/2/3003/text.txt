I was born in Birmingham in the UK on the 24th August, 1934. The Shaftesbury Society in London helped me overcome my height difficulties; they are a Christian group which cares for young people with disabilities. 

I started performing in 1950 at the age of 16 when I joined the Burton Lester’s Midgets as a performer. Shortly after I became a DJ with Mecca Organization before joining Billy Smart’s Circus as a clown and shadow Ringmaster. Later in my career I toured the country for 9 years doing panto and ice shows, where I met the queen. After leaving the ice, I formed a musical comedy act: The Mini Tones.

My friend Jack Purvis and I later became nightclub performers. Jack would also go on to star in Star Wars. The role of robot R2D2, for which I seem most recognisable, came in the 1977 film Star Wars. I would go on to perform in all 6 Star Wars films as well as documentaries relating to them, and even the Star Wars Holiday Special.

In 1978, as R2-D2, I put my footprints into concrete outside Graumann’s Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles, Hollywood.

I have worked with many comedians including Dickie Henderson, Leslie Crowther, Ken Dodd (as a Diddyman), Little and Large, Russ Abbot, Ben Elton, Dick Emery and Dave Allen. I have also been on 3,2,1 and Opportunity Knocks and even met Laurel and Hardy.

I am really happy to support The Christmas Jumpers Co and their super range of Christmas jumpers.  Their efforts help raise money for the ICOEF, a superb children’s charity.
