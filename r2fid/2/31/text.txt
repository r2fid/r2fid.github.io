As a young boy I was mesmerized when the ESB movie came out on cinema. Not only was it filmed in the beautiful vicinity of Finse, Norway (Hoth). It took the story to a new level. It also formed my life and made me chose an occupation in the theatre and film industry with lighting and effects.

Joining the R2 builders in 2009 and 501st Legion in 2014.

Being a proud guard to our emperor and Lord Vader. Spreading joy and happiness to kids of all ages is a privilege. It has given me a lot of inspirations.
Look good! Go troop! Have fun!
