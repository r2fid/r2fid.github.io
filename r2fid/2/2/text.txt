You've found M.E.!

My R2-D2 is primarily all aluminum with the exception of steal feet, and is being run with the RSeries Controller system.

I also worked on the graphics and music for the R2FID applications released for SWCA, and I hope you find enjoyable.

The next step is animating more panels and installing the many gadgets that R2 shows off in the films.
