You've visited the replica sandcrawler 
that was built by Michael McMaster.

Sandcrawlers were large, slow, treaded 
vehicles, used as self propelled bases 
for mining squads. 

Most notable example of usage of these 
vessels, later adated by Jawas for theirmobile homes, was on Tatooine, where 
bulky sandcrawlers climbing the dunes 
were a common sight.
