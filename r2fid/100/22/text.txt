Advanced Droid Building

Fri. April 17| 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM | Star Wars Fan Stage – 303ABCD

From the casual Star Wars fan to George Lucas himself, people appreciate the achievements of the R2-D2 Builders’ Club. It is said that Mr. Lucas asked the Builders at Star Wars Celebration III, “Where were you guys when we were making the movies?” This thought went full circle when members of the R2-D2 Builders’ Club in the U.K. were chosen to create the main Artoo used in The Force Awakens. Join members of the club as they share information on how they have continued to evolve and improve on their craft, and develop effective, advanced building methods. Demos and giveaways.
